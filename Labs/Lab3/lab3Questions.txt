# Import the packages

# 1) (5 points) Read the vertebrate.csv data

# 2) (15 points) The number of records is limited. Convert the data into a binary classification: mammals versus non-mammals
# Hint: ['fishes','birds','amphibians','reptiles'] are considered 'non-mammals'

# 3) (15 points) We want to classify animals based on the attributes: Warm-blooded,Gives Birth,Aquatic Creature,Aerial Creature,Has Legs,Hibernates
# For training, keep only the attributes of interest, and seperate the target class from the class attributes

# 4) (10 points) Create a decision tree classifier object. The impurity measure should be based on entropy. Constrain the generated tree with a maximum depth of 3

# 5) (10 points) Train the classifier

# 6) (25 points) Suppose we have the following data
testData = [['lizard',0,0,0,0,1,1,'non-mammals'],
           ['monotreme',1,0,0,0,1,1,'mammals'],
           ['dove',1,0,0,1,1,0,'non-mammals'],
           ['whale',1,1,1,0,0,0,'mammals']]
testData = pd.DataFrame(testData, columns=data.columns)

# Prepare the test data and apply the decision tree to classify the test records.
# Extract the class attributes and target class from 'testData'

# Hint: The classifier should correctly label the vertabrae of 'testData' except for the monotreme

# 7) (10 points) Compute and print out the accuracy of the classifier on 'testData'

# 8) (10 points) Plot your decision tree
